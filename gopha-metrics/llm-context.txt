This sub-project of the Gopha toolset is designed to compare two video clips and generate the following data:

    - PSNR 
    - SSIM
    - Temporal SSIM
    - VMAF
    - MSE per phase cycle

What is unusal about this tool is that it is specifically designed for testing frame rate conversion solutions.

A set of YUV sequences are generated at 50p and 60P.  The sequences are identical and have a 100% frame match (MD5 level match) at each second, 
i.e. at N, 2N, 3N etc (where N is the frame rate) the images generated are identical.  The sequences are of green balls bouncing around the screen
with a sort of colour cycling plasma-field in the background.

These sequences are generated by the tool "gopha-gen".

Workflow:

    - The 50P sequence is then converted to H264 and HEVC @ 22 MBPS CFR, CBR as a .TS sequence
    - These sequences are then fed into a Frame Rate Conversion tool that creates 60I and 60P outputs with the same stream properties (e.g. 22MBPS, same Level /quality etc as the inputs in HEVC and H264)
    - The 60 FPS output is then compared to the GENERATED 60 FPS YUV sequence.
    - Because the movement is all linear, the FRC output TS at 60 should in an ideal case of perfect motion estimation, be identical to the GENERATED 60 FPS sequence.


What Gophamet does:

    - Syncs the files to the 0th frame
    - Creates an error video (grayscale), an error_amplified video and an errors heatmap video.
    - Generats data i can use in Excel
    - Genereates a HTML report.
